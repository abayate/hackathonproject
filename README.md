<h2>🧠 Overview</h2>
<p>
  <strong>PhishBait</strong> is a beginner-friendly phishing <strong> interactive chatbot </strong> and <strong> detection tool </strong> built to help users check whether a URL is safe or malicious. The program provides <strong>real-time link analysis </strong> by simulating API checks (like VirusTotal, PhishTank, and Google Safe Browsing) to flag dangerous links.
</p>
<p>
  Phishing is a form of cyberattack that tricks users into revealing sensitive information 
  (usernames, passwords, credit card numbers) or installing malware. This project provides 
  a <strong> real-world cybersecurity tool</strong> to help users identify suspicious websites.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Phishing Detection Chatbot  
An interactive chatbot that allows users to test URLs by selecting from known safe and unsafe links. The chatbot analyzes each link and responds with its risk level.

### ⚡ Real-Time Risk Evaluation  
Instant feedback simulates how threat intelligence tools (like VirusTotal or Google Safe Browsing) flag malicious links—helping users make safe decisions before clicking.

### 🧭 Beginner-Friendly Interface  
Built with **React + Vite**, the interface is clean, responsive, and easy to use—ideal for learners and cybersecurity awareness training.

## 🔌 Simulated API Checks *(For Educational Use)*

> PhishBait simulates how real-world phishing detection works using mock responses from popular threat intelligence services.

- 🧪 **VirusTotal (Simulated)**  
  Mimics scanning the URL against multiple antivirus engines and blacklists.

- 🧠 **PhishTank (Simulated)**  
  Compares the URL against a database of known phishing sites.

- 🛡️ **Google Safe Browsing (Simulated)**  
  Emulates checking the URL against Google’s list of deceptive and harmful sites.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User Input**:  
   The user selects or enters a URL into the chatbot interface.

2. **Detection Phase** *(Simulated)*:  
   The system "checks" the link using mock responses based on whether it’s a known safe or unsafe link.

3. **Chatbot Response**:  
   The chatbot returns a result:
   - ✅ "This link appears safe."
   - 🔴 "This link appears to be unsafe based on simulated scan results."

## 🧩 Why It Matters

Phishing is one of the most common cyber threats worldwide. Many users click harmful links without realizing the risk.  
**PhishBait** teaches how phishing detection works in a safe, simulated environment—making cybersecurity **more accessible** to beginners and non-technical users.

> 🎯 **Our Mission**: Build real-world, hands-on tools to raise cybersecurity awareness and help users spot phishing threats before they click.
