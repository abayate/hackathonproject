By: Anthony Bayate Jr, David Arosemena, Aboluwarin Songonuga

Excited to share our latest cybersecurity project, KeanUHackThis — a phishing detection chatbot designed to help users identify potentially malicious websites before clicking on them.

🔍 What It Does:
We built a web application that allows users to input a URL into a simple chat interface. The chatbot evaluates the link and instantly responds with whether it's likely to be safe or phishing.

💡 Key Features:

Phishing Detection Chatbot – Enter a URL and receive a real-time risk assessment.

Real-Time Feedback – Fast results help users make safe decisions.

User-Friendly Interface – Built with React + Vite for a smooth, modern experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + Vite (fast, lightweight dev experience)

Code Editor: VS Code

APIs Integrated:

VirusTotal – Checks URL against antivirus engines.

PhishTank – Verifies if a site is in the phishing database.

Google Safe Browsing – Flags URLs reported as unsafe by Google.

🧠 Why This Matters:
Phishing is one of the most common cyber threats today, often tricking users into revealing sensitive data or installing malware. This tool empowers users—regardless of technical background—to check suspicious links and stay safe online.

🎯 Goal:
Make cybersecurity accessible, interactive, and practical for everyday users.
