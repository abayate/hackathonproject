<h2>🧠 Overview</h2>
<p>
  <strong>PhishBait</strong> is a web application that hosts an <strong>interactive chatbot</strong> 
  where users can enter a URL to determine whether it’s likely to be phishing or safe.
</p>
<p>
  Phishing is a form of cyberattack that tricks users into revealing sensitive information 
  (usernames, passwords, credit card numbers) or installing malware. This project provides 
  a <strong>real-world cybersecurity tool</strong> to help users identify suspicious websites.
